Description:
    Generates a migration class to be executed as a data task. This uses the schema_migrations
    table to ensure that all data tasks are run once and only once.

Example:
    rails generate data_task MigrateSomeData

    This will create:
        db/data_tasks/20120822023011_migrate_some_data.rb
