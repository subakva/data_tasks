Description:
    Generates a migration class to be executed as a release task. This uses the schema_migrations
    table to ensure that all release tasks are run once and only once.

Example:
    rails generate release_task DoSomethingAfterRelease

    This will create:
        db/release_tasks/20120822023011_do_something_after_release.rb
